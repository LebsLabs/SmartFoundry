Where smart contracts are “crafted”

Hello World!

This repository hosts my Smart Contracts, written in Solidity, a language I’ve grown fond of.

The contracts are primarily based on Patrick Collins’ tutorials on YouTube and serve as practice for learning bridging, deployment, and general Solidity coding. Similar code can be found elsewhere on the web, so the focus here is more on learning and experimentation.

The added value comes from the READMEs, where I explain how each smart contract works, as well as the tools, plug-ins, hot wallets, and other resources used in the crafting process.

This repository is a work in progress and subject to constant updates.

The repository includes: 

- SimpleStorage - a Smart contract deployed on ZkSync L2 Sepolia Testnet that helps us to store a name of a person and his or her favorite number.

- FundMe - a smart contract that accepts() and sends() funds. The contract helps to understand how the smart contracts are reading(import) data from other SmartContracts, in this case: chainlink feeds(ETH/USD converter).
          Within this Smart Contract is also possibe to read simple Smart contract mathematics where we learn to convert Eth, Gwei & Wei using 'Scentific notations' or 'literals' for very long number e.g. 1e18.
