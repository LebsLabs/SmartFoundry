SmartFoundry

Where smart contracts are “crafted”

Hello World!

This repository hosts my Smart Contracts, written in Solidity, a language I’ve grown fond of.

The contracts are primarily based on Patrick Collins’ tutorials on YouTube and serve as practice for learning bridging, deployment, and general Solidity coding. Similar code can be found elsewhere on the web, so the focus here is more on learning and experimentation.

The added value comes from the READMEs, where I explain how each smart contract works, as well as the tools, plug-ins, hot wallets, and other resources used in the crafting process.

This repository is a work in progress and subject to constant updates.

Wishing you a great day,
