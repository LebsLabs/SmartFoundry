SmartFoundry

Where smart contracts are “crafted” 🚀

Hello World! 👋

This repository hosts my personal Smart Contracts written in Solidity — a language I've grown to love.
The contracts are primarily inspired by Patrick Collins' excellent YouTube tutorials and serve as hands-on practice for learning key concepts like bridging, deployment, and general Solidity development. Similar code examples can be found across the web, so the main focus here is learning and experimentation.

What makes this repo special?
The real value lies in the detailed READMEs for each contract, where I break down:
- How the smart contract works under the hood
- The tools, plugins, hot wallets, and resources used during development
- Step-by-step deployment instructions and insights
This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly as I continue learning.

Contracts Included:

SimpleStorage
A basic smart contract deployed on the zkSync Era Sepolia Testnet. It allows storing a person's name and their favorite number.
- 🔗 View on zkSync Block Explorer
- 🔗 Verify on zkSync Etherscan equivalent

FundMe
A crowdfunding-style contract that allows users to fund and withdraw ETH. Great for understanding:
- How smart contracts import and read data from external contracts (in this case, Chainlink Price Feeds for ETH/USD conversion)
- Basic arithmetic in Solidity: converting between ETH, Gwei, and Wei using scientific notation literals (e.g., 1e18)
- 🔗 Chainlink ETH/USD Price Feed on Sepolia

More contracts and detailed explanations coming soon!
  Wishing you a great day,
